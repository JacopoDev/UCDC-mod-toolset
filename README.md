2. On the top bar go to **Mod Tools ‚Üí Create ‚Üí New Mod**
3. It will ask for the name of the mod, and will create a directory for this mod in the `Assets` folder
4. Add a new script in this new folder, for testing purposes add this code inside:
```
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UCDC_Mod_Api.GameInterfaces;
using UCDC_Mod_Api.Models.TextGen;
using UCDC_Mod_Api.ModInterfaces;
using UMod;

namespace Hello_World_Mod
{
    public class HelloWorld : ModScript, ITextAiAccessor
    {
        // game will call it to provide its API database to the mod
        public void SetProvider(IAiApiProvider database)
        {
            database.SetActiveTextAccessor(this); // Makes our script control the text generation
        }
        
        // a method that game will use to generate message, it is called as an async Task
        public int GenerateMessage(IChatProvider aiProcessor, Action<TextResult> finishedAction)
        {
            int result = SendAfterTime(finishedAction).Result;
            return result;
        }
    
        private async Task<int> SendAfterTime(Action<TextResult> finishedAction)
        {
            await Task.Delay(500); // Waits for 0.5 seconds - emulate thinking, giving time for animations
        
            TextResult result = new TextResult()
            {
                Code = (int)HttpStatusCode.OK, // this will tell the game that generation went without errors
                Message = new Message()
                {
                    role = "assistant", // possible values - system, assistant, user
                    content = "Hello World!" 
                }
            };
        
            finishedAction.Invoke(result);
            return result.Code;
        }
    }
